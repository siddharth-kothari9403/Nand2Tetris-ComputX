# Project 4 overview
This folder contains .asm files for 2 programs- fill and mult.
Fill will fill the screen with black if a key is pressed, and white if no key is pressed.
Mult is a simple program to multiply 2 values.
It also contains .tst and .cmp files which we need not create, they are available at the website directly.
This is true for all files with these extensions.

# Project 5 overview
This folder mainly contains 3 files- CPU.hdl, Memory.hdl and Computer.hdl.
CPU.hdl is a chip to run the hack instructions. Memory.hdl is the corresponding memory.
Computer.hdl is the putting together of these chips to make a Hack Computer, to run Hack instructions.

# Project 6 overview
This folder contains an assembler for the Hack language, written in Python.
